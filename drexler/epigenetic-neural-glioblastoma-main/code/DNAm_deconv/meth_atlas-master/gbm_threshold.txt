GBM Neural Signature Threshold
==============================

Following Drexler et al. (Nature Medicine 2024) approach:
'The combined dataset was dichotomized into low- and high-neural
tumors using the median neural proportion.'

Dataset: 219 GBM samples

Statistics:
  Mean: 0.2313
  Median (threshold): 0.2290
  Std: 0.1485
  Min: 0.0000
  Max: 0.7650

Classification rule:
  High-Neural: Cortical_neurons >= 0.2290
  Low-Neural:  Cortical_neurons < 0.2290
